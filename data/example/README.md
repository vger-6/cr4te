* `audio` — Royalty-free MP3 tracks from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/)
* `documents` — Sample PDF files and other assets created specifically for this demo

## Quick-Start

Using the example content and *cr4te*, we are going to build HTML pages that look similar to this:

<img src="project_page.png" alt="Screenshot Project Page" width="100%"/>

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Install cr4te

> **⚠️ Note**
> It is recommended to create a virtual environment first.

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vger-6/cr4te.git
cd cr4te
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Generate JSON Metadata and Build HTML Site

> **⚠️ Note**
> `cr4te.json` files are automatically generated by the `build-json` command and saved directly into the original folders (e.g., `/path/to/cr4te/example/data/Artists/Noomi/cr4te.json`).

> **⚠️ Note**
> Ensure that `<output_folder>` does not already exist, as it will be deleted!

Generate JSON metadata from your media folder and build the HTML site:

```bash
python cr4te.py build -i example/data/Artists -o <output_folder> --open
```

E.g. replace `<output_folder>` with `example/data/out`
