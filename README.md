# cr4te

> **⚠️ Under Construction**
> This project is still in development. Features, structure, and configuration may change without notice.

A fast, static site generator for organizing and showcasing media collections.

cr4te scans your existing folder structure, extracts metadata and media (images, videos, audio, documents), and generates clean, responsive HTML galleries. With built-in search, tagging, filtering, and pagination, it's ideal for archiving, browsing, or publishing rich media portfolios—no manual curation or database required.

## Example Folder Structures

Your folder structure should follow a nested, hierarchical format that reflects creators and their projects. For example:

```
Domain/
├── Alice/
│   └── Project1/            # Media folder (images, videos, documents,...)
├── Bob/
└── Bob & Charlie/           # Collaboration folder
    └── ProjectZ/            # Media folder
```

This could represent domains like:

* **Music** → Musician → Album
* **Library** → Author → Book
* **Movies** → Director → Film
* **Design Portfolios** → Designer → Project

...and so on.

Each leaf folder (e.g., Project1, ProjectZ) contains the media and optional metadata used to build the final site.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vger-6/cr4te.git
cd cr4te
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Generate JSON Metadata and Build HTML site

See also the [Quick-Start](https://github.com/vger-6/cr4te/blob/main/data/example#quick-start) which includes a step-by-step guide using example data.

> **⚠️ Note**
> cr4te.json files are automatically generated by the build command and saved directly into each creator’s original folder (e.g., <input_folder>\*/cr4te.json). These files can be manually edited to override or extend metadata such as birth dates, aliases, tags, or project descriptions.

> **⚠️ Note**
> Ensure that `<output_folder>` does not already exist, as it will be deleted!

```bash
python cr4te.py build -i <input_folder> -o <output_folder>
```

See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) if something is not working.

### Optional: Custom Configuration

```bash
python cr4te.py build -i <input_folder> -o <output_folder> --config path/to/my_config.json
```

### Optional: Apply a Domain Preset

```bash
python cr4te.py build -i <input_folder> -o <output_folder> --domain-preset film
```

Available presets:

* `art` (default)
* `film`
* `music`
* `book`

If `--config` is not specified, cr4te uses internal defaults.

Additional options:

* `--max-images` — Set maximum images per media group (overrides config). The default is 20
* `--image-sample-strategy` — Image selection strategy: `spread`, `head`, `all`
  * `spread` (default): even sampling throughout the list
  * `head`: take the first N images
  * `all`: take all images

If `--image-sample-strategy all` is used `--max-images` has no effect.

---

## Configuration

Your configuration file should be in JSON format and can override labels and media matching rules. Use the `--print-config-only` flag to print a config file on screen or redirect it to a json file for further adjustment and later use.

```bash
python cr4te.py build [options] --print-config-only > my_config.json
```

---

## Creator Metadata: `cr4te.json`

Each creator folder must contain a `cr4te.json` file. The `cr4te.json` files are automatically generated by the `build` sub command. Some fileds can be edited by hand.

See this [`cr4te.json`](https://github.com/vger-6/cr4te/blob/main/data/example/Artists/Noomi/_cr4te.json) file from the example.

### Editable Fields (excerpt)

* `born_or_founded`: Must be in `YYYY-MM-DD` format
* `active_since`: Must be in `YYYY-MM-DD` format
* `nationality`: Any free-form text
* `aliases`: List of alternate names
* `info`: Optional bio text (supports Markdown)
* `tags`: Format should be `Category:Tag`, e.g. `Occupation:Photographer`. `Photographer` without a category works too.
* `projects[*].info`: Optional per-project description
* `projects[*].tags`: Tag list for each project
* `members`: If this is a group folder, add member names
* `collaborations`: Add collaboration names

> **⚠️ Note**
> Other fields might be overridden automatically during the build process. Editing those fileds by hand is futile.

## Output Example

* `index.html` — Overview page
* `projects.html` — Projects overview page
* `creators/<creator>.html` — Individual profile pages
* `projects/<project>.html` — Individual project pages
* `tags.html` — Browse by tags

Thumbnails are automatically generated into `/thumbnails/`.

---

## Requirements

* Python 3.10+
* Pillow
* Mutagen
* Markdown
* Jinja2
* Pydantic

---

## Troubleshooting

### LocalStorage not Working Under `file://`

Some browsers (notably Firefox with strict settings) block `localStorage` access across pages loaded with the `file://` protocol.

**Solution:** run a lightweight local server from your output folder:

```bash
cd /path/to/OutputFolder
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser.

This will fix localStorage issues and better match how your site behaves when deployed online.

---

### Building HTML Pages Not Working?
If running the `build` command doesn't work or fails silently, it may be due to insufficient file permissions. Try running the command with administrator privileges (e.g., using sudo on Unix-based systems or an elevated Command Prompt on Windows).

Also, ensure:
* The output directory is writable.
* All required dependencies are installed.
