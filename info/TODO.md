# TODO

This file tracks product ideas. Durable requirements live in [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md); future refactoring guidance lives in [REFACTORING_GUIDELINES.md](REFACTORING_GUIDELINES.md).

## Review Backlog

These items come from the full-codebase review of the Python build pipeline, generated HTML, copied assets, JavaScript, and CSS contracts. They are TODOs, not durable requirements.

### High Priority

- [ ] Surface render and asset failures as structured build issues. Thumbnail failures, missing staged media, and similar rendering problems should appear in the build summary rather than only in logs.

### Medium Priority

- [ ] Avoid repeated full creator reloads while rendering collaboration/member links; use lightweight summaries where practical to preserve the streaming build shape.
- [ ] Unify build exception handling and reporting across the full build lifecycle.
  - [ ] Fold metadata reconciliation skips and warnings into the structured build summary where practical.
  - [ ] Make CLI abort/error paths return clear non-zero exit statuses for automation-friendly command behavior.

### Low Priority

- [ ] Add `--dry-run` flag to `build`.
- [ ] Add a `--prune-thumbnails` build option that removes orphaned cached thumbnails and hash sidecars without regenerating valid thumbnails.
- [ ] Add optional progress reporting for large folder trees.
